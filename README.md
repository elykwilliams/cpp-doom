# C++ Doom

C++ Doom is an educational focused version of Doom converted to C++. It is a fork of Crispy Doom 5.7.2 originally started by [Jason Turner](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp-doom)

The current goals of this version is not to become another source port of the game and to support all the Doom engine has to offer, but to become a educational tool that uses a C++ converted version of Doom as a teaching platform.

Due to this some things have been removed, for example Hexen/Heretic/Strife support.

If you are looking for a source port of Doom then we recommend looking at [Crispy Doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/crispy-doom) or this [list of ports on the Doom Wiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port)
