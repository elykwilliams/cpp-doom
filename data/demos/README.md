# DOOM Demo Regression tests

A set of demos used to test if the build is functioning ok.

The demo-check tool runs each demo in `-cicddemo` mode and compares the output of the statdump to a good known result.

Some demos are from this excellent resource: http://www.classicdoom.com/odddemos.htm

Much thanks to the classic doom and doom speed demo archive community.
